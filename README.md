# Juniper IVE / SA and Pulse Connect Secure TA for Splunk

This is a simple TA written to support Juniper IVE and SA / Pulse PCS data in WELF format

NOTE: A syslog listener is required. Splunk recommends using a dedicated syslog server, and not a listener on a splunk instance itself.

Refer to Ivanti documentation for configuring the appliance to send its data via syslog.
